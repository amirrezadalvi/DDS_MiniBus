# Configuration

The DDS Mini-Bus runtime uses JSON configuration files. The `config.json` file is loaded at startup and supports partial runtime updates for certain parameters.

## YAML Example

The `example.yaml` file is provided for documentation purposes only. It is not parsed or used by the application. It serves as a human-readable equivalent of the JSON configuration structure.

To use YAML in your own tooling or documentation, convert it to JSON as needed. The runtime does not support YAML input.
